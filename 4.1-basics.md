## Keywords

- `await` 
    The `await` keyword is where things can get asynchronous. Await is like a unary operator: it takes a single argument, an awaitable (an “awaitable” is an asynchronous operation). Await examines that awaitable to see if it has already completed; if the awaitable has already completed, then the method just continues running (synchronously, just like a regular method).

    If `await` sees that the awaitable has not completed, then it acts asynchronously. It tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method when it completes, and then returns from the async method.

- `async` enables the use of the `await` keyword


## Awaitables

- these are the types that can be awaited
- it's based on convention
- Task/Task<T> are awaitables
- there are others too
- 99% you don't have to think about this

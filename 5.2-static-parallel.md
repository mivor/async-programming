## Parallel.* (Static Task Parallelism)

### Invoke
- execute any number of delegates in parallel
- can handle up to millions of delegates efficiently
- result collection is up to the application, must handle thread-safety

### For/Foreach
- similar to regular version, executes a delegate as the body
- best suited when the delegate does some computation
- must handle thread safety
- use ParallelLoopResult parameter for controlling the loop and optimized data management

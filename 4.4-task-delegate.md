- used for computation:
    * background work (Task.Run)
    * parallel (Parallel.*, PLINQ)
    * dynamic task parallelism (TaskFactory.StartNew)
- represents the state of that operation (Created, WaitingForActivation, WaitingToRun, etc)
- can have parent/child relationships
- supports chaining with: task.ContinueWith(...);
- it is acceptable to block on these

```c#
Result = await Task.Run(() => ComputeResult());
```

### Older Models

#### Async Programing Model (APM)
- Begin/End method paris + IAsyncResult
- use Task.Factory.FromAsync

#### Event-Based Async Pattern (EAP)
- DownloadDataAsync + DownloadDataCompleted
- use TaskCompletionSource to wrap the completion event into a Task

#### BackgroundWorker
- limited control when to update the UI DoWork + RunWorkerCompleted
- easy to refactor to 1:1 Task based version with Task.Run
